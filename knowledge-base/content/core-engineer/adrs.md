## What
An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) is a record of an Architectural Decision (AD), which is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.

## Why

ADRs are an effective way to encode the following [delivery principles](/delivery/delivery-principles/):

* **Operate as an idea meritocracy**: key technical decisions should be documented and reviewed, not made in isolation.
* **Disagreeing should be done efficiently**: technical decisions should be made quickly and not revisited unless the context or requirements change. Too often engineering teams spend time having the same technical debates without making a decision.
* **Once a decision is made, everyone should get behind it**: Technical decisions don't always get full agreement, but if the team has an ADR process they believe in, once an ADR is accepted the team should get behind it unless something changes

## How

The most important part is agreeing to the process as a team rather than any particular tooling.
Many tools exist. Two we recommend are:
* [CLI for managing ADRs](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools)
* [Log4brains ADRs](https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains)

We recommend including them in a central repo and making it part of the team work flow to create ADRs as part of a definition of done.
