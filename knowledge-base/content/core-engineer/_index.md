### What is a Core Engineer?

A Core Engineer is a Software Engineer with deep Infrastructure knowledge. 
A Core Engineer is equally at home working on a large scale platform engineering or building a product.

A Core Engineer's background is typically either a traditional software engineer that 
have gotten involved in infrastructure because that has become the bottleneck to delivery,
or an infrastructure engineer that have learnt software engineering to make them more effective 
at managing infrastructure at scale.

### What do Core Engineers do? 

They solve a business's hardest problems e.g.
* Build bespoke Kubernetes based PaaS aka [Core Platforms](../core-platform) or Digital Platforms.
* Improving the P2P across a large organisation aka [Core P2P](../p2p).

For Core Engineers not working on strategic platform engineering projects they are typically the 
Principal Engineer in a delivery team and will identify when platform engineering would speed up 
delivery for a team or department or company.
