## What is pair programming?

Others explain it better than us:
* [Pair Programming: 7 Habits of Highly Effective Coders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ySLQ5_cQ34)
* [On Pair Programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html)

## Why do core engineers encourage pair programming?

* Avoiding knowledge silos, no single engineer owning code, promoting continuous knowledge between engineers in a team 
* Encourages a good culture of engineers knowing each other and empathising with each other. We all have different skills and knowledge and it is fine to be open about that, no one needs to pretend they know everything as we don’t!

## What is Mob programming?

* [Mob Programming: A Whole Team Approach • Woody Zuill • GOTO 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHOVVnRB4h0)

## Why do core engineers encourage mob programming?

We don’t do it as often as pair programming but are happy to encourage mob programming at key points in a project
If the team you’re working on wants to do it, go for it!
