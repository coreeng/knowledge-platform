# Connected Kubernetes

Connected Kubernetes is the base Kubernetes that a Core Platform is built upon. It will be the first roadmap item after initial sprint 0 and Platform Path to Production tasks. At a minimum it needs a basic authentication mechanism integrated with SSO and a registry strategy.

As a Platform Engineering department grows a single team can be responsible for a corporate connected Kubernetes and other platform teams can build features on top of this base later.
