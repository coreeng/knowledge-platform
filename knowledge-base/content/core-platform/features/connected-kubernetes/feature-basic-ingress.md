## Motivation
Provide a basic ingress solution for dev ready onboarding so the full Platform Ingress isn't required.

## Requirements
* Tenants able to expose a service internally in dev
* Platform team able to expose a service internally in dev


## Additional Information
Only needs to be implemented if tenants need to onboard in dev before [Platform Ingress](../ingress/feature-platform-ingress) can be completed.
