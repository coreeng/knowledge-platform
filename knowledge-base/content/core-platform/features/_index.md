Our Core Platform product definition is the “what” rather than the “how”.
It is made of features grouped by category into roadmap items. 
Roadmaps items are high level groupings such as "Ingress".

A feature can be one epic, or broken down into many epics.

We don’t document how to break epics down into tasks.
That is up to the delivery teams and project specific constraints.
