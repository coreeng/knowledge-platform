## Motivation
Tolerate a Cloud Provider outage

Use managed services from different cloud providers

Different tenants need to be on different cloud providers

## Requirements
* Core Platform, with the same tenant interface, deployed across multiple Cloud Providers.

## Additional Information
Requires Multi Region Ingress and Multi Provider Registries for applications to be deployed active active across cloud providers.

The primary use-case need not be multi cloud provider for the same application, it could be that different applications need cloud provider managed services.
