## Motivation
Ability to expose any service deployed to the platform to the internet using the corporate standard CDN.

## Requirements
* Ability to expose services via a CDN e.g. Akamai

## Additional Information
Mechanism (possibly just document) how to integrate with corporate CDN i.e. how to expose a service to the Internet. There should be a clear delineation between how far the Core Platform exposes a service vs existing mechanisms e.g. Akami

What certificates are required where?
