* To have confidence in the kubernetes setup, a dashboard can show the health of deployed synthetic load 

* Visualise a history of activity so that patterns that form may be discovered and action may be taken pre-emptively

* Understand availability over differing time periods to ensure that SLOs are able to be met

## Requirements

* Dashboard that shows Synthetic Load Health

* Metrics To Collect:
  * Latency
  * Response Codes (to measure availability)

* Have as few requirements as possible on the cluster
