## Motivation

* Have confidence in the kubernetes setup by having a continuously running service that is under a continuous load

* Be aware of any problems before clients are

## Requirements

* To deploy a test service and place under synthetic load that tests the availability of that service

* To collect metrics on the health of the deployed service under synthetic load 

* The following should be configurable:
  * Throughput - Min 3TPS, so we have enough datapoints per hour to calculate all the percentiles
  * Additional endpoints to be hit by the injector - ingress, edge, but should always hit the target
  * Thresholds and latency
