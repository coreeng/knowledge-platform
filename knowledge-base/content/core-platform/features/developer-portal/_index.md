# Developer Portal 

The developer portal is the UI for the Core Platform.

It defines how you:

* Onboard
* View existing applications (service catalog)
* Discovery of the running instance of the application (kubernetes integration)
* Technical Documentation 

Whereas most of the Core Platform feature list doesn't specify an implementation preference, we recommend implementing a developer portal with [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).
