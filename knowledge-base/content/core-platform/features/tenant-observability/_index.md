# Tenant Observability
Being deployed to a Core Platform should provide integration with key corporate monitoring solutions. Such as:
* Centralised metrics stores e.g. Datadog
* Log aggregation e.g. ELK
* Incident management e.g. service now

These integrations are a small amount of work but provide a key carrot to tenants and to other stakeholders.
