## Motivation
Tenant able to support their application.

Platform team doesn’t have scope to support an aggregated metrics store.

## Requirements
* Exporting metrics from tenant applications to a third party metric store

## Additional Information
Tenants/departments may already have a centralised observability platform and don’t want to deviate away when moving applications to the core platform.

Exporting to an external store reduces operational overhead on the platform team.
