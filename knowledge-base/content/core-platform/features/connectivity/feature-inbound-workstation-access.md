## Motivation
Tenant and platform engineres need access from their local work stations

## Requirements
* API servers from all environments reachable from workstations in the office and on any VPNs
* Suitable mechanism to download or generate kubeconf for all clusters

## Additional Information
Often this just works however we have had issues at various places with DNS resolution on VPNs.
