### Motivation

* Environment visibility for the platform engineering team.

### Requirements
* See what version of every platform component is deployed to each environment
* What version of each policy is deployed to each core platform environment.
* See status of each platform component in each environment

### Additional Information

A single pane of glass across multiple clusters. Can be useful for seeing the different environments but particularly aimed at scenarios where there are multiple clusters per environment e.g. multi cloud or hybrid cloud.

What is in the single pane of glass should be defined for each platform and can be built incrementally.
