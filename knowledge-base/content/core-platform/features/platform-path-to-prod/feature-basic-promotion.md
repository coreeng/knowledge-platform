### Motivation

A base level of confidence for platform deployments.

### Requirements

* The platform should be versioned
* Clearly identify which version is in which environment
* Each version should have to pass through the lower environments, environments canâ€™t be skipped
* The only manual action is triggering a deployment, no manual interaction with the platform

### Additional Information

[Automatic promotion](feature-automatic-promotion.md) is the ideal but requires significant effort. Automatic promotion should be prioritized in a second phase.
