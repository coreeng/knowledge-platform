#### Overview

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a specific type of address used to access resources on the internet. It serves as the “web address” that identifies the location of a resource, such as a web page, image, video, or file, on a network, typically the World Wide Web.

_Figure 1-1. The structure of a URL_

A URL consists of several components, such as protocol, domain name, path, parameters and fragment (anchor).

In our example we have:

- protocol \-  **https**
- domain name \- **cecg.io**
- path \- **/webapp**

So, we are going to establish a connection with **cecg.io** using **https** protocol.
