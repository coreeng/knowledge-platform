Netcat, often referred to as **nc**, is a powerful networking utility that can read and write data across network connections using TCP or UDP. Itâ€™s commonly used for debugging and testing network connections, transferring files, and setting up network communication between systems.

The basic syntax: 

```
nc [flags] [hostname] [port]
```

There are several useful flags:

| Flag | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| \-l | Listen mode. This makes nc listen for incoming connections on the specified port. Useful for setting up a server. nc \-l \-p 12345 |
| \-p | Specify the port to use. nc \-l \-p 12345 |
| \-u | Use UDP instead of TCP. By default, Netcat uses TCP. nc \-u \-l \-p 12345 |
| \-v | Verbose mode. This option provides more detailed output about the connection status. nc \-v cecg.io 80 |
| \-z | Zero-I/O mode. This flag is used for scanning. It does not send any data, just checks if the port is open. nc \-z \-v cecg.io 1-1000 |
| \-w | Specify a timeout for the connection (in seconds). This is useful to prevent hanging if the connection is not established.  nc \-w 5 cecg.io 80 |

The combination of **-z** and **-v** flags is used for port scanning.

```
$ nc -zv cecg.io 443

Connection to cecg.io port 443 [tcp/https] succeeded!
```
