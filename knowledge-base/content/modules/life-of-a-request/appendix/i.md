Using curl is a great way to debug connectivity issues, especially for checking if a machine can reach a specific endpoint, test server responses, or troubleshoot network connections. Below are some common curl commands and techniques that can help with connectivity debugging.

This is the most basic way to check if you can reach a website or endpoint:

```
$ curl https://cecg.io

Redirecting to https://www.cecg.io/
```

If there is no response, or it hangs, this can indicate network or DNS resolution issues.

Use the **-I** option to fetch only the headers of the response:

```
$ curl -I https://cecg.io

HTTP/2 301
content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
date: Thu, 24 Oct 2024 12:45:07 GMT
location: https://www.cecg.io/
server: Netlify
```

The **-v** option provides detailed information about the request and response, including DNS resolution, TLS handshake, and more:

```
$ curl -v https://cecg.io

You can use curl to test connectivity to a specific port (such as testing an API endpoint):

```
$ curl http://cecg.io:443

Client sent an HTTP request to an HTTPS server.
```

To test if SSL/TLS is properly configured and if there are any certificate issues:

```
$ curl https://expired.badssl.com

curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: certificate has expired
More details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.
```

The **--insecure** flag skips certificate validation. If youâ€™re having TLS issues, it may show more details about the failure.

```
$ curl -v https://expired.badssl.com --insecure

Use timeouts to prevent curl from hanging indefinitely:

```
$ curl --connect-timeout 1 --max-time 5 http://httpbin.org/delay/10

curl: (28) Operation timed out after 5004 milliseconds with 0 bytes received
```

By using these curl techniques, you can get a lot of information that can help troubleshoot connectivity issues, network configuration, DNS problems, SSL certificate issues, and more.
