# Knowledge Platform

The Knowledge platform is made up of our Knowledge Base, currently focussed on platform engineering, and our Bootcamp, a hands on set of exercises that expose engineers to key platform engineering practices.

### What is the Knowledge Base?

The knowledge base is the collective knowledge gained from implementing many large, successful, platform
engineering products covering:

* [Core Platform](/core-platform/): How to build a bespoke, Kubernetes based, developer platform.
* [Core P2P](/core-p2p/): How to build a common Path to Production (P2P) across many development teams.
* [Core Engineer](/core-engineer/): What an Engineer working on a Core Platform or Core P2P should know.
* [Delivery](/delivery/): How to deliver large software and infrastructure projects in an agile way that allows reporting to high level stakeholders.

### What is the Bootcamp?

Having helped many clients adopt Platform Engineering the Bootcamp is a condensed, hands-on, tour of
what we think an engineer needs to know to be an effective Platform Engineer.

#### Our approach to training

We believe that doing is the most effective way of learning. CECG's bootcamps expose engineers
to key, curated problems that would normally take many years of real work experience.

The ways of working are as important as the work engineers produce so the bootcamp is run following CECG's reference delivery process including:

### Future of the Knowledge Platform

We are constantly evolving how we train and support our engineers to become great platform engineers. Some of the things we're working on for the future:

* Skeleton applications to start each module
* Auto grading modules based on acceptance criteria so you know you've implemented the requirements without a reviewer
