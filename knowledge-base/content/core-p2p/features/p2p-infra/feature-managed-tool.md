## Motivation

Have a highly available, resiliant, managed CI/CD tooling that the common P2P can be implemented on.

## Requirements

* Support automated pipeline generation
* Support custom build agents per tenatn
* Support multi tenanted setup

## Questions 

Can an existing SaaS offering be built on?

If a Core Platform is in place, can the tool be deployed there to avoid most of the infrastructure work?

Which tool should be used?

* Align with the current most commonly tool vs our recommended tool: Tekton

Deployment model?

* Instance per tenant vs a fully multi tenanted setup

How will this epic be broken up?
