Time to get started!

Each module is made up of:
* Learning plan epic: Work with your Scrum Master, Mentor and Product Owner to decide what external courses and reading you need to do.
* Project: A set of epics to complete. The epics are included in the module description and imported to your GitHub repo.

Once you've read through the background and the epics 
schedule a [module planning session](../ways-of-working/rituals-artfifacts#module-planning).
