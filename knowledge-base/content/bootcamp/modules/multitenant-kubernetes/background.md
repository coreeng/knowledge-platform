### Architecture Decision Records

We'll be introducing a new engineering process as part of this module: [Architecture Decision Records](/core-engineer/adrs/).
You can store the ADRs for the rest of the bootcamp in your GitHub repo.
We suggest using the ADR tool recommended in [ADRs](/core-engineer/adrs/).

### Background material 

Review what a Core Platform is vs regular Kubernetes:
* [Core Platform](/core-platform/)

Understand about deployment models and promotion:
* [Promotion](/core-p2p/promotion)
* [Deployment Models](/core-p2p/deployment-models)

#### Cloud Guru

If you didn’t do the [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)](https://acloudguru.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad) earlier in the bootcamp, now’s the time to do it.

Then follow that up with the [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)](https://acloudguru.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka) course. Don’t bother with the practice exams as we won’t be doing the certification.

Kubernetes tooling:
* [Helm Deep Dive V3](https://acloudguru.com/course/helm-deep-dive-v3)

To implement parts of canary deployments:
 * [Prometheus and Java](https://learn.acloud.guru/handson/bcd8596c-9c70-4106-afe3-fe78db13f090) 

#### Plurasight 

* [Kubernetes Core Concepts](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/kubernetes-developers-core-concepts)
* Any parts of [Certified Kubernetes Administrator](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/certified-kubernetes-administrator)
* [Networking, Ingress, Service](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/configuring-managing-kubernetes-networking-services-ingress)
  * Key for implementing Canary Deployments
