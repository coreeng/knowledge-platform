The bootcamp is not a traditional course where there is a lot of content delivered via lectures or videos.
It is a directed set of projects to work on to expose you to many parts of platform engineering that
in a normal working environment would take many years to be exposed to. So instead of a teacher you'll be 
interacting with: a Scrum Master, a Product Owner, and a Mentor.

### Scrum Master

* A [Scrum Master](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-scrum-master) is your point of contact throughout the bootcamp
  * Don't hesitate to contact them with any questions and feedback 
* They facilitate many of the [bootcamp rituals](../rituals-artfifacts)

### Product Owner

The product owner of the bootcamp will work with you on the motivation and requirements of your 
[epics](../rituals-artfifacts/#epic). 

The Scrum Master will invite them to your [planning](/bootcamp/ways-of-working/rituals-artfifacts/#module-planning) and any [epic defuzz](/bootcamp/ways-of-working/rituals-artfifacts/#epic-defuzz) sessions. 

### Mentor 

* Every one in the bootcamp is assigned a mentor. They will attend your:
  - [Planning](../rituals-artfifacts/#module-planning)
  - [Epic Defuzzs](../rituals-artfifacts/#epic-defuzz)
* Once an epic is ready for review let them know
* Need any PR / deliverable reviewed?
* Reach out at any time to get clarification on an epic
