The bootcamp follows a subset of our recommended delivery processes.
This page serves to clarify terms around backlogs and rituals.

## Artifacts

### Backlog of work

We break work into deliverables, small pieces of work that can be done by 1 person or a pair of people. 
Large parts of work are delivered as part of an epic.
For an epic or a deliverable a [defuzz meeting](#epic-defuzz) can be scheduled that gets everyone together to define the 
epic or deliverable before work starts.

#### Epic

An epic is a large chunk of work that can’t be captured in a single deliverable a.k.a. task in 1-2 weeks.
An epics should:
* Contain the motivation and requirements of an epic before design and implementation begin.
* After this point the motivation and requirements of the epic are locked-in and should not change.
* The team will define the next deliverable for that epic on a sprint-by-sprint basis.
* If an epic would benefit greatly from an upfront design, this should be done as the first deliverable.
* Each sprint deliverable is then demoed when complete by calling a Demo.
* Epic deliverables do not need to be defuzzed because:
  * they shouldn’t contain requirements or motivations but should contain goals that bring us closer to fulfilling the requirements.
  * they've already been scoped as a team during the planning session.

##### Why do epics only define motivation and requirements?

We believe solutionising should be done by engineering teams. Agreeing just the motivation and requirements allows
engineers to get all the information they need from Product Owners, Architects and any other Stakeholders
then do what they do best: build engineering solutions to meet requirements.

#### Task
A task is the smallest unit of delivery. A task should take no more than 2 weeks.
If a task takes more than 2 weeks it becomes an epic and is broken down into deliverables.
Task defuzzes should be optionally called as required by the judgement of the engineer and/or team. Some examples of when this could be are:
* If there are major decisions to be made.
* If the requirements are not clear.
* If priorities have changed.
* If you don’t believe it should be played.

#### Deliverable
A deliverable is a type of task that is part of an epic


## Rituals

### Daily Standup
* **Facilitator**: Bootcamp Scrum Master
* **When:** Every day
* **Attendees:**
  * All current bootcampees
  * Product Owner when available

### Module Planning
* **Facilitator:** Bootcamp Scrum Master
* **Attendees:**
  * You! The Bootcampee :)
  * Product Owner
  * Your assigned mentor

### Demos

When finishing an epic talk to your product owner to see if it warrants a demo.
In the real world we demo every epic. In the bootcamp we demo a few important ones.

* **Facilitator:** The Bootcampee. You'll be arranging and running this.
* **Attendees:**
  * You! The Bootcampee :)
  * Product Owner
  * Your assigned mentor
* **Optional Attendees:**
  * All other bootcampees

### Epic Defuzz

Agree on the motivation and requirements of an epic before design and implementation begin.
The outcome of this meeting should be a firm agreement between all parties.
After this point the motivation and requirements of the epic are locked-in and should not change.
The team will define the next deliverable for that epic on a sprint-by-sprint basis.
If an epic would benefit greatly from an upfront design, this should be done as the first deliverable.

During the bootcamp we will try and defuzz epics in the planning session if there is time.


###  Task Defuzz

Tasks defuzzes should be optionally called as required by the judgement of the engineer and/or team. Some examples of when this could be are:
* If there are major decisions to be made.
* If the requirements are not clear.
* If priorities have changed.
* If you don’t believe it should be played.
