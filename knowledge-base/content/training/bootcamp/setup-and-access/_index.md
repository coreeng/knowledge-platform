## Systems

Ensure you have access to:

* Bootcamp Slack: ask your Scrum Master to invite you. This is your go-to place to ask questions. 
* GitHub Org: create a GitHub account if you donâ€™t have one and ask in slack how to get added to the GitHub organisation if not already a member. 

## GitHub Repository

Bootcamp progress is tracked through your own GitHub repo. 
You should have a GitHub repository with all the epics created. If you don't, ask your Scrum Master.
