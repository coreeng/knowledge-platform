## Motivation

Have the time and space to practice the craft of programming.
This epic can span many weeks if you want to keep doing programming practice throughout the whole bootcamp.

## Requirements

* Pick your initial programming language: Java or Golang
* Complete multiple coding dojos
* Everything is unit tested
* Everything is in version control: create a private repo in the Organisation `bootcamp-katas-<github handle>` 
* At least one of the deliverables is paired on with your mentor 

## Questions / Defuzz / Decisions
This is an optional epic, if you've spent your life programming, don't feel the need to complete it.

{{% notice info %}}
If there are more than one of you starting the bootcamp together, why not pair on it together?
