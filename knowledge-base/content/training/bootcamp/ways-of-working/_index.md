## Agile in Practice

The Bootcamp is run like as an agile project. You'll be working off an epic level backlog but how you implement
each epic is up to you. This is to encourage the principle of solutionising should be led by engineering teams.



For each module you should arrange a planning meeting with:

* [Scrum Master](roles.md#scrum-master)
* [Mentor](roles.md#mentor): Your assigned mentor. Don’t have one? Ask your Scrum Master.

Check their calendars for availability.

You’ll agree the work you need to do and create the next [deliverables](rituals-artfifacts.md#deliverable) for the in progress epics.
Epics for each module will already be imported into your repository.

During the week you should keep all your tasks up to date with progress.

When finishing an epic, arrange a demo with the Scrum Master, mentor and any other bootcampees.

You should have a GitHub repo with the initial epics already created. If you don’t, ask your Scrum Master.

## An Evolving Bootcamp

As an engineer going through this bootcamp you are encouraged to improve it!

* See a typo? Report it to your Scrum Master.
* Think something is wrong? Suggest a change.
* Want to improve the reference application? Raise a PR against the original!

We can’t promise every suggestion will be incorporated, but we guarantee there are no stupid suggestions.
