The request from the **web-app** successfully reached the **user-api** pod. In order to generate a response, the **user-api** pod needs to make a call to the external third-party OAuth Service to get the ID of the user.

**Note:** We donâ€™t really have a real OAuth Service for the purpose of this learning module, so we will be using a mock service [https://httpbin.org/uuid](https://httpbin.org/uuid) to generate UUIDs.
