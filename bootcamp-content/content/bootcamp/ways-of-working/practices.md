### Project Management
* Always keep your project board up to date.
* Daily issue updates are best.
* Epics can be broken down into deliverables (tasks) or you can keep progress on the parent epic.
* If any epic is unclear, arrange an epic defuzz with your scrum master, product owner and mentor.

### Version Control
* For any existing repo, e.g. the reference applications, fork it into the same organisation and ensure the fork is private.
  * Use the name `<original repo name>-<github handle>`
* Some epics require fresh repositories, create these as private repos in the organisation
  * Use the name `bootcamp-<github handle>-<name>`
* Raise PRs in your repos and assign your mentor to them 
* Normally, you will not be required to PR changes into the reference applicatons, but if you do you’ll want a fresh branch or fork of that repo without all your other changes.

### Remote Working
When working remotely with each other and at client it is important to over-communicate. We recommend:
* Heavily updating issues on your progress. Don’t just say something doesn’t work, say why, and include errors etc.
* Always turn on your camera on video calls. It builds a rapport with your colleagues.
