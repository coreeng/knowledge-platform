Welcome to the CECG Platform Engineering bootcamp. A quick tour of everything you need to effectively
work in a Platform Engineering team focussing on building a Kubernetes based bespoke [PaaS aka a Core Platform](/core-platform/)
and a [consolidated Path to Production](/bootcamp/modules/p2p-fast-feedback/epic-p2p/) for how users of the platform deploy applications to production.

#### Prerequsites

The bootcamp is targeted at experienced technologies practitioners with the following backgrounds:

* Software Engineer looking to get into Platform Engineering
