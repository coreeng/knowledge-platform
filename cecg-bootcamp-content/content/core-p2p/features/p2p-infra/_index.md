# P2P Infrastructure

P2P Infrastructure is everything required to build automated CI pipelines. This roadmap item doesn’t define how this infrastructure is used, only providing it as a service.

Many of these features are managed by a “shared services” team rather than a central platforming team. We aim to re-use as much as possible at clients and only provide what is missing.
