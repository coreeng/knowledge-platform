## Motivation

Standard tool/step for scanning container vulnerabilities.

Able to define a policy on what vulnerabilities result in a pass/fail of the step.

A bit carrot for both tenants and security:

Tenants implement security standards without any effort

Security get mass adoption of their security standards

## Requirements

Built images are automatically scanned

Policy available for what CVEs are allowed for deployment

## Questions

Can this integrate with Image Management so there are no requirements on the tenant?

What tool should be used?

* Thrivy
* Qualys (paid for)
* Crowdstrike

Alternatively this can be part of the platform registry rather than the P2P. If it is part of the platform registry then there must still be quick feedback to tenants.
