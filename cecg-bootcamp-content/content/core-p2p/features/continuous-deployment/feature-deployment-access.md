## Motivation

For the P2P to be useful it needs to have connectivity and authentication to target deployment infrastructure.

Ley examples are

Kubernetes API

Cloud Provider APIs for provisioning

Each time a new tenant comes with a new deployment target some work will need to be done but any tenants that want to deploy to an existing target should work right away.

## Requirements

Connectivity to the target

Authentication mechanism to the target

Additional Information
To debug issues with the CI/CD tooling
