# Continuous Deployment 

Tools and infrastructure to enable CD. 

Depending on the tooling the CI/CD pipeline may be one thing, in others they are very separate.

CI gets a built and verified service. We often advocate doing CI verification in a deployed environment, but we still consider that part of CI.

CD takes that service and promotes it through environments that other areas of the business, and eventually customers, depend on.
