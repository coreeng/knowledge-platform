## Motivation
Run Kubernetes on secure hosts.

Reduce attack surface with host hardening.

## Requirements
* Secure Host: Use standard hardening techniques e.g CIS for Linux on the Kubernetes nodes, if they are managed by the containers platform.
* Limited audited access to hosts
* Vulnerability Analysis of hosts
* Network Logs
* Regular patch and updates of nodes

## Additional Information
Pick which parts should be done as MVP and break rest into separate epics.1
