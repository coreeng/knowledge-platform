### Motivation

Well-tested platform with tests for all platform features to avoid any regressions
Set the expectation of the level of testing
Agree up front with platform engineers how this will happen


### Requirements

* ADR for how platform features are tested
* Each platform feature is captured in an end to end acceptance test.
* Platform team notified of any test failures
* Ways of working updated to say that a red test should be the top priority
