### Motivation

Platform development has slowed down due to:
* PR Validation taking too long
* Not enough environments for platform engineer experimentation

### Requirements

* Break up sandbox or have many sandbox environments to enable PR validation and each dev to have a full core platform environment for development and testing.

## Additional Information
If we have the ability to provision the accounts / network there is no need to segregate the sandbox environment. Instead this feature can be implemented with multiple accounts.
